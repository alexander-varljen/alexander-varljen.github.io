### Predictive Modeling Project: DAT-640 Final Project

**DAT-650 Final Project Decision Tree**

**Project Description**

[DAT 640 Final Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MaaLNNyBRTXur2B3V0e1s8Pz4Rw5QLnk/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105763848355793464629&rtpof=true&sd=true) is a report for a project in which I built a prediction model for a fictional insurance company "TIC". The business problem presented was to predict which customers where likely to purchase TIC's "Caravan" insurance policies. The project involved some preliminary exploratory analysis of the dataset and the construction of a pruned decision tree model, which could predict who would purchase a Caravan insurance policy with about 92% accuracy. The tools and resources used for this project included the TIC dataset, the R programming language and packages, and RStudio. Documentation of the R code used is included in the report.

### Data Visualizations Project: DAT-530

**Project Description**

"DAT 530 Final Project" is a project which focuses on presenting visualizations to three different audiences, which where: Pennsylvania's state budget office, emergency weather management, and the general public. All visualizations for the project were made using Power BI. The visuals are of adverse weather event data in Pennsylvania and use a dataset titled "StormEvents_details-2015-2016". The word document titled ["DAT 530 Final Project"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M9AtdhyY8XFOhr57x_KXTQi49rE7znyI/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=105763848355793464629&rtpof=true&sd=true) is a report explaining the background of the project, the audience needs, and the visualization and presentation proposals (also, a sample of an updating Power BI dashboard for the state emergency office). The word document titled ["DAT 530 Final Project Webpage for Public"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sn0kHfXEoTKZ42QIJts61XkAQ4VuOLCs/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=105763848355793464629&rtpof=true&sd=true) contains a proposed webpage layout for the general public. The PowerPoint presentation titled ["DAT 530 Final Project PowerPoint for SBO"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r0OD_9OLRmNysAlGDiCOVeTzcKG1i4xi/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=105763848355793464629&rtpof=true&sd=true) is of a visualization presentation for the state budget office.

**Description of Projects**

[“DAD 220 Project One”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CoFVIrW8W55dp7rVdbAJmk7R1G8_UBHw/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=105763848355793464629&rtpof=true&sd=true) is the end product of an assignment that I participated in in August of 2020. The goal of this project was to create a database called “QuantigrationUpdates” with three tables called “Customers”, “Orders”, and “RMA”, query their records, update their records, delete their records, and download the records from the “Orders” table onto a csv file using MySQL and the SQL language.

["QuantigrationUpdates_MongoDB"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_g7TenC9WLaE54hyAG3cTDpikewiYOjs/view?usp=drive_link) is a recreation of the commands and functionality of the "DAD 220 Project One" project using the MongoDB NoSQL platform and commands. The file includes an APA style document of the screenshots of the commands used, a "txt" file with the commands, three Excel files of the created and updated database, and a "README" describing the files included in the project.

### SAS Project: DAD 215 Final Project

![Image]()

**Project Description**

["DAD 215 Final Project"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16vteX_fJi3EoGVRfYjCMuJ8fL2PNqT44/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=105763848355793464629&rtpof=true&sd=true) is the documentation of a project in which I used the SAS statistical analysis system to analyze the use of NYC "Citi Bikes" from the NYC "CitiBike" program, and the differences between male and female use in the summer months. The report includes the SAS commands used, their output, a step-by-step explanation of the analysis, and a conclusion of the findings. While the datasets from the years used don't appear to be available publicly anymore, [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) is a link to the updated files.

### Feature Selection Project: DAT-610 Module Six Exercise

**Project Description**

["DAT 610 Module Six Exercise"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PH8iGJLJV5LZNxqSB2pwS9qP1F6hgq0M/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=105763848355793464629&rtpof=true&sd=true) is a project where I was using principal component analysis, linear regression, and logistic regression to inform a set of Key Risk Indicators for a fictional company called "XYZ", an insurance company who is seeking to identify, analyze, and come up with solutions to fraud risk. The document includes screenshots of the R code used for the analysis, the output, and written explanations of the results.
